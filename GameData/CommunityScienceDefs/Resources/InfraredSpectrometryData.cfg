	RESULTS
	{
	default = You measure the IR spectrum in the instrument's view
	default = The spectrometer takes local Infrared measurements
	default = Different levels of heat emission and reflection are detected
	
	SunInSpace = Infrared data from around Kerbol is recorded
	SunInSpaceLow = Mission control messages "DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN"
	SunInSpaceLow = IR measurements briefly go off the charts before the instrument enters safe-mode to prevent damage
	SunInSpaceHigh = Kerbol's Corona is measured by deploying a coronagraph and reveal very high temperatures
	
	MohoInSpace = Moho’s heat emissions are imaged by the IR spectrometer
	MohoInSpaceLow = Surface IR absorption analysis suggest the presence of Iron and other metals
	MohoInSpaceLow = The contrast between the hot day and the cool night sides of Moho are very clear in the IR images taken of Moho
	MohoInSpaceHigh = The Kerbol-facing side of Moho appears bright and very hot
	MohoInSpaceHigh = IR levels recorded. The lab interns will have to figure out if they are from Moho or Kerbol
	
	EveInSpace = Infrared images are taken around Eve
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve's atmosphere absorbs a great deal of Infrared Radiation
	EveInSpaceHigh = Calculations of IR emissions suggest that a lot of Infrared radiation must be trapped beneath the cloud layers
	EveInSpaceHigh = IR Images reveal a very different world from Kerbin

		GillyInSpace = The instrument snaps InfraRed images from around Gilly
		GillyInSpaceLow = Spectrum analysis reveal some metal and Ore formations on the surface
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Thermal reading indicate a lack of any volcanic activity

	KerbinInSpace = Thermal emission data is recorded from around Kerbin
	KerbinInSpaceLow = Surface Infrared maps of farmlands are taken on behalf of Sean's Cannery
	KerbinInSpaceLow = There is a large heat spike near the surface. Oh, it's a rocket launch from KSC!
	KerbinInSpaceLow = The spectrometer detects a very strange anomaly in the ocean below; in the middle of a Typhoon. Mission Control labels it 'Infrakrasnyy Oktyabr'
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = The instrument is tuned to take Infrared maps of the current cloud coverage
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = IR emissions are noted around populated areas to aid in the search of biological activity on other planets
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Infrared images penetrate the cloud layers of Kerbin and brighten different ground features
	
		MunInSpace = The moon appears cold
		MunInSpaceLow = The deeper craters are cold enough to be able to maintain water ice in their shadowed areas
		MunInSpaceHigh = The craters appear much cooler than the highlands
		MunInSpaceHigh = Thermal imagery makes it much easier to identify different terrain features
		
		MinmusInSpace = IR maps of the surface are recorded
		MinmusInSpaceLow = IR data suggests that Minmus is very cold
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Infrared Spectronomy analysis complete: Guacamole
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Elevated areas appear to be warmer than the lower areas
		MinmusInSpaceHigh = Different terrain levels emit or reflect different amount of IR light
		
	DunaInSpace = Infrared wavelength imagery is taken of Duna
	DunaInSpaceLow = Geological features are easily spotted in IR images
	DunaInSpaceLow = The poles are very cold and contain water ice
	DunaInSpaceHigh = IR data reveals that Duna is much colder than theorized
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Despite its desert appearance, Duna is appears rather cold

		IkeInSpace = Heat absorption is measured by the IR spectrometer
		IkeInSpaceLow = IR data suggest the presence of metals and Ore in the surface of Ike
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Ike appears to have a very dark and unreflective rocky surface
	
	JoolInSpace = It takes some time, but IR maps of Jool are finally taken
	JoolInSpace = Jool's auroras glow brightly in this wavelength
	JoolInSpaceLow = Jool's clouds contain many volatile chemicals at very high temperatures
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's cloud zones and cloud belts are clearly distinguishable at different IR wavelengths
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool emits more heat than it receives, suggesting some internal power source
	
		LaytheInSpace = The console beeps as infrared readings are taken of Laythe
		LaytheInSpace = Scans indicate the poles do not contain ice
		LaytheInSpaceLow = IR images show many small, rocky islands
		LaytheInSpaceLow = Analysis indicate that the atmosphere is composed mostly of nitrogen, methane, ethane and acetylene
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = Laythe emits more heat than it receives, similar to Jool
		
		VallInSpace = IR readings are taken of the surface
		VallInSpaceLow = Scans show an icy surface of Vall
		VallInSpaceLow = Spectroscopy analysis reveal water, ammonia and methane on the moon
		VallInSpaceHigh = Thermal imagery shows very uneven terrain. Landing not recommended
		VallInSpaceHigh = Terrain scans capture what could be many volcanoes. Status unknown
		
		BopInSpace = Infrared scans are taken of Bop
		BopInSpaceLow = Scans indicate tentacle-like features on the surface
		BopInSpaceHigh = The moon absorbs much heat from not having an atmosphere
		
		TyloInSpace = The console beeps as scans are taken
		TyloInSpaceLow = Readings show the surface contains cobalt, nickel, and ice
		TyloInSpaceHigh = Scans show ice on the surface
		TyloInSpaceHigh = It's hot. Who'd've thunk?
		
		PolInSpace = The IR console beeps continuously. Is it broken?
		PolInSpaceLow = Scans set for nelop. Results negative
		PolInSpaceHigh = IR scans reveal uneven terrain
		
	EelooInSpace = Eeloo succumbs to the power of Infra-Red imagery
