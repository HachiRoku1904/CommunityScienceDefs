	RESULTS
	{
	default = Valuable data are collected from this ocean.
	default = A scan of this ocean has been completed.
	KerbinSrfSplashedShoresShallow = Kerbin's shallow tidal regions are teaming with microbial life, silt, and a tremendous amount of tiny green tadpole-like animals.
	KerbinSrfSplashedShoresDeep = Signs of advanced life are found in Kerbin's deeper tidal waters; the underwater cameras continue to pick up fast moving green objects passing just out of focus.
	KerbinSrfSplashedWaterShallow = Kerbin's shallow open waters contain relatively little of interest, only some microbial lifeforms and numerous bits of scrap metal.
	KerbinSrfSplashedWaterDeep = Signs of the remains of what appears to be an enormous underwater animal are found in scans of Kerbin's deep ocean waters.
	EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSeaShallow = The shallow ocean region of Eve has very low silt content and no signs of life; the density of the liquid is significantly higher than water.
	EveSrfSplashedExplodiumSeaDeep = Scans of Eve's deep oceans reveal numerous toxic compounds and only trace amounts of water.
	LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSeaShallow = Laythe's open ocean appears to be composed primarily of short hydrocarbons and liquid ammonia with a very low surface temperature.
	LaytheSrfSplashedTheSagenSeaDeep = Temperatures in Laythe's deeper oceans are relatively high, suggesting some kind of internal or tidal heating mechanism.
	LaytheSrfSplashedShores = The tidal regions of Laythe's ocean contain high silt content, but no signs of life.
	TektoSrfSplashedLakes = A scan of Tekto's ocean reveals mostly short chain hydrocarbons at a very low temperature and density.
	TektoSrfSplashedMudflats = The silty liquid of Tekto's mudflats contains a surprisingly high number of complex organic molecules.
	TitanSrfSplashedSeas = Titan's low density ocean is made up mostly of liquid methane and ethane, with no signs of life.
	TitanSrfSplashedShores = The silty ocean near Titan's shores contains some interesting silicates and organic molecules, but no signs of life.
