	RESULTS
	{
	default = Now this looks interesting.
	default = How could this have ended up here?
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It's the KSC!
	KerbinSrfLandedIslandAirfield = This appears to be an underused airfield, possibly built as an emergency landing site for launches from the KSC.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC2 = This appears to be some kind of prototype launch facility, possibly used for training or as an early test location.
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith1 = Rumor is that Jeb found one of these black monoliths on the Mun and actually touched it. Could that be responsible for his unwavering (some would say foolish) bravery in the face of stupefying odds?
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith2 = Getting a closer look at this odd black slate may prove difficult given the steep terrain where it is located.
	KerbinSrfLandedMonolith3 = This monolith seems somehow alien to Kerbin, as if it were placed here by some unseen force.
	KerbinSrfLandedUFO = This appears to be some strange kind of aircraft, possibly a research prototype. It is also emitting several forms of radiation.
	KerbinSrfLandedPyramids = These desert pyramids are one of the few examples of pre-spaceflight, surface-level Kerbal architecture.
	KerbinFlyingLowKSC = It's the KSC, from the air!
	KerbinFlyingLowIslandAirfield = From the air this looks like a nice spot for a landing; a useful alternative to the KSC airstrip.
	KerbinFlyingLowKSC2 = From the air this facility really pales in comparison with the KSC; it is lacking in various important buildings and likely provides only the bare minimum of services required for a launch.
	KerbinFlyingLowMonolith1 = A sharp spike in radio wave emissions is detected after making a close flyby over this object.
	KerbinFlyingLowMonolith2 = Nestled into the mountainside is another one of the strange black monoliths that have been reported at various locations on the surface of Kerbin.
	KerbinFlyingLowMonolith3 = Another mocking face. Who, or what, is this mysterious Squad?
	KerbinFlyingLowUFO = Some strange radio signals are detected while flying over this object. Perhaps some kind of distress signal?
	KerbinFlyingLowPyramids = Viewed from above the scale of this site becomes apparent. There remain, however, few clues about how or why these buildings were constructed.
	MunSrfLandedMonolith1 = This mysterious black slate matches the description of several objects found on Kerbin, what, or who, could be the source of such structures?
	MunSrfLandedMonolith2 = Another mocking face. Who, or what, is this mysterious Squad?
	MunSrfLandedMonolith3 = The mysterious Squad strikes again, surely they must come here for the benefit of all Kerbal-kind
	MunSrfLandedUFO = This oddly shaped spacecraft bears some resemblance to objects described in several mysterious sightings over Kerbin.
	MunSrfLandedArmstrongMemorial = It appears to be a monument of some kind, likely dedicated to a brave forerunner in the exploration of the universe.
	MunSrfLandedRockArch1 = How such a curious rock formation could be formed on the Mun, with no water or weathering action, is an intriguing question.
	MunSrfLandedRockArch2 = Another strange rock formation, this one situated in near the bottom of a crater. Perhaps it was created through some kind of impact.
	MunSrfLandedRockArch3 = Close observation shows what appears to be an extraordinary structure, made out of very ordinary rock.
	MunFlyingLowMonolith1 = A sharp spike in radio wave emissions is detected after making a close flyby over this object.
	MunFlyingLowMonolith2 = This black monolith is nearly invisible against the dark surface of the Mun, only a faint radio signal gives away its presence.
	MunFlyingLowMonolith3 = The surface of this object appears to be a nearly perfect black body absorber, reflecting nothing and showing almost no signs of its existence on any of the scanners.
	MunFlyingLowArmstrongMemorial = This stone memorial stands out amid the bleak Munscape.
	MunFlyingLowUFO = A short, repeating radio signal is detected emanating from this object.
	MunFlyingLowRockArch1 = This arch is just begging to flown through; there is certainly much valuable science to be gained by doing so.
	MunFlyingLowRockArch2 = Perhaps this structure was made as part of some elaborate obstacle course on the surface of the Mun.
	MunFlyingLowRockArch3 = Seen from above this formation almost looks as if it were simply dropped onto the surface.
	MinmusFlyingLowMonolith1 = How this object remains suspended above the surface of Minmus is as much a mystery as its origin, or the meaning of the mocking face etched into its side.
	MinmusFlyingLowMonolith1 = The surface of this object appears to be a nearly perfect black body absorber, reflecting nothing and showing almost no signs of its existence on any of the scanners.
	DunaSrfLandedFace = From the side, the optical imager shows nothing but an ordinary rock. There are however, several curious emissions causing increasing levels of distortion in the other sensors.
	DunaSrfLandedMastCamera = This curious looking instrument appears to belong to some long abandoned spacecraft.
	DunaSrfLandedMastCamera = Faint signs of radiation and electrical activity are detected from this object, a sign that it might not be completely inactive.
	DunaSrfLandedPyramid = This fascinating structure appears at first glance to be nothing more than a curious feature of Duna's surface.
	DunaSrfLandedPyramid = Close scans of this seemingly natural structure reveal a short, repeating pattern of radio emissions.
	DunaFlyingLowFace = Viewed from above the significance of this rock becomes obvious. There is no way to ignore the close resemblance to a Kerbal face.
	DunaFlyingLowMastCamera = What appears to be some kind of spacecraft instrument is jutting out of the surface here. Signs of more buried below?
	DunaFlyingLowPyramid = The precise geometry of this structure becomes more apparent when viewed from above.
	DunaFlyingLowPyramid = Perhaps the radio signals emanating from this structure contain some clue as to its origin.
	VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Visual observation shows what can't possibly be a natural phenomenon; the pattern of arrangement suggests some kind of intelligence at work.
	VallSrfLandedIcehenge = Bursts of powerful, repeating radio emissions are detected coming from these structures.
	VallFlyingLowIcehenge = The seemingly careful arrangement of these structures suggests some deeper meaning or purpose; perhaps a message of some kind?
	VallFlyingLowIcehenge = Powerful bursts of radio wave activity are detected while flying over this formation. Could this be some kind of transmitter or relay device?
	TyloSrfLandedCave = The cave looks rather cozy, almost like it's inviting you in to get comfortable and maybe stay a little while...
	TyloSrfLandedCave = When approaching this formation all of the background radio noise begins to die out, as if something is actively blocking it.
	TyloSrfLandedFace = Strong electromagnetic emissions are detected in this area, but nothing out of the ordinary is visible through the optical scanner.
	TyloFlyingLowCave = Upon visual inspection this appears to be nothing but an ordinary rock formation.
	TyloFlyingLowCave = While making a pass over the cave, all radio emissions seem to drop to zero, curious given Jool's normally high levels of background radio noise.
	TyloFlyingLowFace = The faint outlines of some kind of face-like object are visible on the surface here. Curiously, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to Kerbal faces.
	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The initial visual observation is difficult to believe at first glance. Signs of extraterrestrial biological life? An explanation for the unseen, lurking menace felt by all Kerbalnauts? Some kind of elaborate hoax? Closer study is warranted...
	BopSrfLandedDeadKraken = The round cleft (a mouth of some kind?) glows brightly in a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. One can only hope that nothing will ever pry open that menacing cavity.
	BobFlyingLowDeadKraken = Observations show what can only be described as some kind of kraken, a Space Kraken if you will, lying on the surface of Bop. Dead, one can only hope...
	BopFlyingLowDeadKraken = Significant emissions of UV and X-ray radiation are detected. Observe caution when making any closer approaches to the entity.
