	TitanInSpaceLowHighlands = These relatively high-elevation areas are mostly featureless in IR scans, showing characteristics of common silicates and other basaltic minerals.
	TitanInSpaceLowShores = IR images of these low lying areas reveal what appear to be floodplains, with smoothly weathered features indicative of recently being covered by liquid.
	TitanInSpaceLowSeas = Near-IR reflections from the surface confirm the presence of stable liquid hydrocarbon oceans on Titan.
	TitanInSpaceHigh = The dense cloud cover on Titan is opaque to most visible light, but UV and IR images reveal many surface level features.
	UranusInSpaceLow = Images taken during solar occultations reveal high concentrations of water, methane and ammonia in the atmosphere.
	UranusInSpaceHigh = UV images of Uranus' atmosphere reveal clouds of mostly water and ammonia ice.
	PlutoInSpaceLow = Pluto's surface looks to be composed primarily of frozen ice.
	PlutoInSpaceHigh = Pluto's thermal emissions are minimal being this far out from the sun.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Prominent absorption bands in the near-IR spectrum indicate that this is an olivine-rich asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Near-IR images of this asteroid indicate high concentrations of iron and nickel compounds; likely an iron-rich stony asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = UV absorption at around 400nm and a very low overall albedo suggest that this is a carbonaceous asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = A flat IR spectrum and UV absorption around 300nm indicate that this is a water-rich, carbonaceous asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = The very low albedo and the traces of volatile organic compounds suggest this is a organic-rich asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = An IR absorption spectrum consistent with iron- and magnesium-silicates suggests that this is a stony asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLow = Weak IR absorption around 750nm and 1000nm indicates the presence of olivine and other silicates in this relatively bright asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = The moderate albedo of around 0.2 and the relatively flat visible and near-IR spectra suggest that this is a metallic asteroid, composed primarily of iron and nickel.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = This asteroid exhibits a largely featureless spectrum with a slightly reddish spectral slope and a moderately high albedo of 0.3.
	AsteroidInSpaecLowMetallic = With a slight red slope in the near-IR spectrum and a moderate albedo, this is most likely a metallic asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = The very low albedo of around 0.05 and IR characteristics of this asteroid are consistent with a heavy, carbonaceous asteroid.
