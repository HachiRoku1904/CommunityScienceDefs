	RESULTS
	{
	default = An accurate recording of this planet's reflected solar irradiance is collected.
	default = Measurements from a wide range of UV to IR wavelengths provide details about this planet's composition and characteristics.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's ocean covered surface results in a fairly low visible light albedo, and its thick atmosphere absorbs most UV and near-IR light.
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = Complete measurements are made of Kerbin's reflected solar irradiance; perhaps long-term recordings of such data will reveal the impact on Kerbin's climate of the near constant rocket launches made from the planet's surface...
	MunInSpaceHigh = The reflective regolith on the Mun's surface gives the moon a very high albedo in most of the UV to near-IR range.
	MinmusInSpaceHigh = The bright surface of Minmus reflects most visible and IR light; the far-IR channel records only a weak signal though, indicating that there is no internal geological activity to produce such thermal emissions.
	SunInSpaceHigh = The sun is continuously emitting light at all recorded wavelengths, nearly overwhelming the sensors.
	MohoInSpaceHigh = Close proximity to the sun results in high absolute levels of irradiance despite Moho's relatively dark surface and IR-absorbing characteristics.
	EveInSpaceHigh = Eve's thick atmosphere absorbs most wavelengths in the UV to far-IR spectrum, only the visible light channel records any significant levels of reflected light.
	GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly's featureless surface reflects little visible and IR light; a result of its dark surface and IR-absorbing, silicate-rich surface.
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Strong UV and shortwave IR absorption by Duna's atmosphere suggests the presence of high levels of Carbon Dioxide and possibly Ozone.
	DunaInSpaceHigh = Duna's bright polar regions reflect most visible light, giving the planet a high overall albedo.
	IkeInSpaceHigh = The bright surface of Ike strongly reflects visible and UV light; the IR channels record much lower output.
	DresInSpaceHigh = A brief flutter in the temperature reading from the radiometers hints at the presence of some nearby object; probably just a calibration error.
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Strong thermal recording by the UV and IR radiometers made while scanning Jool are likely to be a result of internal emissions, possibly caused by auroras or other electrical storms, rather than reflected solar irradiance.
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = Significant long wavelength IR signals are detected during scans of Laythe; these are typically a sign of internal thermal emissions due to geological activity.
	VallInSpaceHigh = Vall's bright surface and lack of a thick atmosphere allow for most incident radiation to be reflected; only a few dips are present in the UV channels, signaling the presence of UV-absorbing water ice on the surface.
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo's very bright surface reflects most visible and UV light, giving the moon a very high overall albedo.
	BopInSpaceHigh = Bop presents a curiously high level of intermittent near- and far-IR emissions; its distance from the sun and lack of any geological activity would seem to rule out any simple explanations for such phenomena...
	PolInSpaceHigh = The visible light channel detects only a modest signal, but the UV and IR radiometers measure very high levels of reflected light from Pol's surface.
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo's nearly white surface reflects nearly all UV, visible and IR light, ruling out the possibility of water ice. Perhaps the surface is coated with something more interesting...
	SarnusInSpaceHigh = The bright colors of Sarnus' atmosphere reflect significant amounts of visible light.
	HaleInSpaceHigh = This tiny moonlet has a moderate visible light albedo, with roughly half the surface being extremely bright, while the other half is very dark.
	OvokInSpaceHigh = Throughout the visible spectrum Ovok reflects nearly all light; its UV and IR signals are only slightly lower.
	SlateInSpaceHigh = Slate's bright surface and lack of an atmosphere causes most light in the UV to IR range to be reflected.
	TektoInSpaceHigh = Tekto appears very dark in UV and visible light reflections, but the IR-sensitive radiometers detect high levels of reflected light.
	UrlumInSpaceHigh = Urlum's bright upper cloud layer reflects nearly all visible light.
	PoltaInSpaceHigh = The bright, greenish surface of Polta reflects significant amounts of visible light, suggesting that its surface may contain high levels of water ice.
	PriaxInSpaceHigh = The light, rocky appearance of Priax suggests that it may be a captured stony asteroid, something not entirely expected this far out in the solar system.
	WalInSpaceHigh = Wal's colorful surface reflects significant amounts of visible and UV light, though its IR emissions are slightly lower.
	TalInSpaceHigh = The darkly colored surface of Tal has a somewhat polished appearance, reflecting significant levels of visible light.
	NeidonInSpaceHigh = Readings from Neidon show very high levels of far-IR emissions; these most likely occur due to some sort of internal heating, rather than reflected light.
	ThatmoInSpaceHigh = The bright color of Thatmo reflects significant amounts of visible light in most wavelengths.
	NisseeInSpaceHigh = Nissee's polished marble appearance reflects strongly in both visible and UV wavelengths.
	PlockInSpaceHigh = Plock has alternating regions of high and low albedo; suggesting significant levels of surface differentiation.
	KarenInSpaceHigh = Karen's dark surface reflects little visible light, but has relatively high levels of UV reflections.
	MercuryInSpaceHigh = Close proximity to the sun results in high absolute levels of irradiance despite Mercury's relatively dark surface and IR-absorbing characteristics.
	VenusInSpaceHigh = Venus' thick atmosphere absorbs most wavelengths in the UV to far-IR spectrum, only the visible light channel records any significant levels of reflected light.
	MoonInSpaceHigh = The reflective regolith on the Moon's surface gives the it a very high albedo in most of the UV to near-IR range.
	MarsInSpaceHigh = Strong UV and shortwave IR absorption by Mars' atmosphere suggests the presence of high levels of Carbon Dioxide and possibly Ozone.
	DeimosInSpaceHigh = The featureless surface of Deimos reflects little visible and IR light; a result of its dark surface and IR-absorbing, silicate-rich surface.
	PhobosInSpaceHigh = The dark surface of Phobos weakly reflects visible and UV light; the IR channels record much lower output.
	JupiterInSpaceHigh = Strong thermal recording by the UV and IR radiometers made while scanning Jupiter are likely to be a result of internal emissions, possibly caused by auroras or other electrical storms, rather than reflected solar irradiance.
	IoInSpaceHigh = The visible light channel detects a moderate signal, but the UV and IR radiometers measure very high levels of reflected light from Io's surface.
	EuropaInSpaceHigh = Europa's bright surface and lack of a thick atmosphere allow for most incident radiation to be reflected; only a few dips are present in the UV channels, signaling the presence of UV-absorbing water ice on the surface.
	GanymedeInSpaceHigh = Ganymede's very bright surface reflects most visible and UV light, giving the moon a very high overall albedo.
	CallistoInSpaceHigh = Callisto's bright surface and lack of an atmosphere causes most light in the UV to IR range to be reflected.
	SaturnInSpaceHigh = The bright colors of Saturn's atmosphere reflect significant amounts of visible light.
	TitanInSpaceHigh = Titan appears very dark in UV and visible light reflections, but the IR-sensitive radiometers detect high levels of reflected light.
	UranusInSpaceHigh = Uranus' bright upper cloud layer reflects nearly all visible light.
	PlutoInSpaceHigh = Throughout the visible spectrum Pluto has a very high albedo; its UV and IR signals are only slightly lower.
