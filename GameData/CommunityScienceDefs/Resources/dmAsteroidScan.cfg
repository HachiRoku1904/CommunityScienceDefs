	RESULTS
	{
	default = A detailed internal scan of this asteroid is conducted.
	default = The signal passes through this asteroid, giving data about the electrical characteristics of its internal structure.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Features detected during signal transmissions through this asteroid's interior suggest that it is a stony object.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = A significant delay in the signal transmission suggests that this asteroid's interior is composed of strongly dielectric materials.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = The complex interior structure of this asteroid generates an interesting pattern after repeated signal transmissions.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowCarbonaceous = Distortions in the transmitted signal are consistent with high concentrations of hydrated silicates.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = This dense asteroid absorbs most of the radio signal, preventing a detailed analysis of its internal composition.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowComet = Large internal structures are detectable from signal reflections within this comet. Combined with data on its electrical properties this suggests that the comet is only loosely held together.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowMetallic = Different signal transmission paths through this asteroid reveal several large scale internal features.
	AsteroidInSpaecLowMetallic = The radio signal strength is greatly decreased after transmission through this asteroid, indicating that it is made up of very dense material.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowIcy-Organic = Several interior structures are detected during scans that are consistent with large water ice deposits.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = The signal is strongly diffused by the loosely packed interior of this asteroid.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = Little internal variation in this asteroid's structure is detected after several signal transmissions.
	AsteroidInSpaceLowStony = The electric properties of this asteroid's interior are consistent with that of light-weight, loosely packed silicates.
